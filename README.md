# Animated Pixel

![Preview](https://github.com/Erik3010/animated-pixel/blob/da94954532d10588c2e585c41ab20b27b27a8c05/preview.mp4)

An experimental visual project that explores pixel-level animation by simulating a dynamic ripple effect. Each pixel moves like a wave, with the center of the ripple following your mouse as you move it across the screen.

Highly inspired by [this](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2355052) projects
