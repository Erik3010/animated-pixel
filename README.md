# Animated Pixel

![Preview](https://github.com/Erik3010/animated-pixel/blob/cf9879f77ee40b242d66c412a57d4df5aae210a4/preview.gif)

An experimental visual project that explores pixel-level animation by simulating a dynamic ripple effect. Each pixel moves like a wave, with the center of the ripple following your mouse as you move it across the screen.

Highly inspired by [this](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2355052) projects
